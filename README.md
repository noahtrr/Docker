# Introduction

I want to use this repository to collect some of my used docker containers or ones that I would like to use in the future.

These containers aren't always configured to my liking or have outdated compose files or outright non working compose files.

This won't do for me, so enjoy my cleaned out and hopefully maintained docker compose repo!
